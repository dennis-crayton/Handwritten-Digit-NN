# Handwritten Digit Recognition Neural Network
This project is a neural network built with TensorFlow and Keras to recognize handwritten digits from the MNIST dataset.

## Features
- Loads and preprocesses the MNIST dataset
- Builds a neural network with 1 input layer, 2 hidden layers, 1 output player
- Trains the model and evaluates its accuracy
- Visualizes predictions and class probabilities

  ## How to Run
  1. Clone this repository.
  2. Create Python Environment
  3. Install Dependencies:
     
     `pip3 install jupyter tensorflow numpy matplotlib`
  5. Access Jupyter Notebook using:
     
     `jupyter notebook`
  6. Run cells to train and test the model

  ## Notes
  - This project is based on a tutorial and was created to practice/understand neural networks using specific libraries.
